      "**Subject:** A lone figure, shot from behind, sitting on a weathered wooden porch swing. Their body language should be slumped, shoulders hunched, conveying a deep sense of sadness and defeat.  Don't show their face, allowing the viewer to project their own interpretation of grief onto the figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background:**  A vast, storm-ravaged landscape. The remnants of a once-vibrant forest are now skeletal trees, stripped bare by a recent, violent storm.  The ground is littered with debris, and a thick fog rolls in, clinging to the wreckage. The sky is awash in the bruised hues of twilight, with the last rays of sunset casting long, mournful shadows across the scene. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Lighting & Atmosphere:** Use cool, desaturated tones to emphasize the melancholy atmosphere. The fading light should cast a bluish-grey tint across the landscape, while the fog adds an element of claustrophobia and unease.  A subtle shaft of warm, golden light could illuminate a single object in the distance (perhaps a lone, surviving flower or a child's forgotten toy) to hint at a past life, now lost. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Impression:**  The image should evoke a sense of profound loss and isolation, with the ravaged landscape mirroring the internal state of the grieving figure. The subtle hints of the storm's destruction should whisper of recent trauma, leaving a lingering sense of unease and uncertainty. \n",
